# 3D Motion and Structure Reconstruction

In this project, I addressed the problem of 3D motion and structure reconstruction
using optical flow field from the sequence of images of moving objects. More specifically,
using the optical flow field and intrinsic parameters of the camera, the goal was to
recover the 3D motion and structure of the moving object with respect to camera
reference frame.
